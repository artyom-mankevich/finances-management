### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start --reset-cache
```

## Environment Variables

You can configure some of Create React Native App's behavior using environment variables.

### Configuring Packager IP Address

When starting your project, you'll see something like this for your project URL:

```
exp://192.168.0.2:19000
```

The "manifest" at that URL tells the Expo app how to retrieve and load your app's JavaScript bundle, so even if you load it in the app via a URL like `exp://localhost:19000`, the Expo client app will still try to retrieve your app at the IP address that the start script provides.

## Troubleshooting

### Networking

If you're unable to load your app on your phone due to a network timeout or a refused connection, a good first step is to verify that your phone and computer are on the same network and that they can reach each other. Create React Native App needs access to ports 19000 and 19001 so ensure that your network and firewall settings allow access from your device to your computer on both of these ports.

Try opening a web browser on your phone and opening the URL that the packager script prints, replacing `exp://` with `http://`. So, for example, if underneath the QR code in your terminal you see:

```
exp://192.168.0.1:19000
```

Try opening Safari or Chrome on your phone and loading

```
http://192.168.0.1:19000
```

and

```
http://192.168.0.1:19001
```

If this works, but you're still unable to load your app by scanning the QR code, please open an issue on the [Create React Native App repository](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) with details about these steps and any other error messages you may have received.

If you're not able to load the `http` URL in your phone's web browser, try using the tethering/mobile hotspot feature on your phone (beware of data usage, though), connecting your computer to that WiFi network, and restarting the packager. If you are using a VPN you may need to disable it.
